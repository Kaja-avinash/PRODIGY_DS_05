# Prodigy DS Task 05

## One Line Description
Analyzing a dataset of road accidents to identify patterns and trends.

## Introduction
The dataset used for this task is a collection of road accidents that occurred in a specific region. The dataset contains various attributes such as the time of the accident, day of the week, age band of the driver, sex of the driver, educational level, vehicle driver relation, driving experience, type of vehicle, owner of vehicle, service year of vehicle, defect of vehicle, area accident occurred, lanes or medians, road alignment, types of junction, road surface type, road surface conditions, light conditions, weather conditions, type of collision, number of vehicles involved, number of casualties, vehicle movement, casualty class, sex of casualty, age band of casualty, casualty severity, work of casualty, fitness of casualty, pedestrian movement, cause of accident, accident severity.
